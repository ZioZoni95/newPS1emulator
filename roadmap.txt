Project Roadmap & Status:

Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)

‚úÖ CPU Core & Instructions (Guide Section 2): Implemented.
‚úÖ Memory System (RAM, BIOS) (Guide Section 2): Implemented.
‚úÖ Interconnect & Address Mapping (Guide Section 2 & 6): Implemented & Reviewed.
‚úÖ Basic DMA (GPU & OTC) (Guide Section 3): Implemented.
‚úÖ Basic GPU State & Commands (Guide Section 4): Implemented.
‚úÖ Basic OpenGL Renderer (Guide Section 5): Implemented.
‚è© Debugger (Guide Section 7): Skipped (for now).
‚úÖ CPU Instruction Cache (Guide Section 8): Implemented.

Phase 2: Core System & Peripheral Emulation (In Progress)

‚è≥ Timers & Accurate Interrupts: Started. Basic step logic implemented. Further accuracy improvements pending.
‚è≥ CD-ROM Drive Emulation: State-driven command handling started. BIOS now attempts to boot from the loaded disc image, which is a major milestone.
   - NEXT: Needs implementation of a basic CD filesystem (ISO9660) to read `SYSTEM.CNF`.
   - NEXT: Needs DMA integration for sector data transfers.
   - NEEDS: Implementation of all remaining CD-ROM commands.
‚ùå Controller & Memory Card Emulation: Not Started.
‚ùå SPU (Sound Processing Unit): Not Started.
‚ùå DMA Enhancements (Accuracy, Other Channels): Not Started.

Phase 3: Advanced GPU & System Refinement (Not Started)

‚ùå GPU - VRAM Read (`GP0(0xC0)`): Not implemented. The BIOS currently stalls when it tries to read data from VRAM. This is a known issue to fix before games will boot.
‚ùå GPU - Texturing & Advanced VRAM: Not Started.
‚ùå GPU - GTE (Geometry Transformation Engine): Not Started.
‚ùå GPU - Timings & Video Output: Not Started.
