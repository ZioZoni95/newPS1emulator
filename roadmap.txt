Project Roadmap & Status:

Phase 1: Foundation (Mostly Done)

✅ CPU Core & Instructions (Guide Section 2): Implemented.
✅ Memory System (RAM, BIOS) (Guide Section 2): Implemented.
✅ Interconnect & Address Mapping (Guide Section 2 & 6): Implemented & Reviewed.
✅ Basic DMA (GPU & OTC) (Guide Section 3): Implemented.
✅ Basic GPU State & Commands (Guide Section 4): Implemented.
✅ Basic OpenGL Renderer (Guide Section 5): Implemented.
⏩ Debugger (Guide Section 7): Skipped (for now).
✅ CPU Instruction Cache (Guide Section 8): Implemented.

Phase 2: Core System & Peripheral Emulation (In Progress)

🎯 Timers & Accurate Interrupts: In Progress. Current focus is implementing timer counting and VBLANK interrupt generation to resolve BIOS hang.
✋ CD-ROM Drive Emulation: Blocked by Timers. Command logic implementation is next, but requires working VBLANK interrupts to proceed past the BIOS loop.
❌ Controller & Memory Card Emulation: Not Started.
❌ SPU (Sound Processing Unit): Not Started.
❌ DMA Enhancements (Accuracy, Other Channels): Not Started.

Phase 3: Advanced GPU & System Refinement (Not Started)

❌ GPU - Texturing & Advanced VRAM: Not Started.
❌ GPU - GTE (Geometry Transformation Engine): Not Started.
❌ GPU - Timings & Video Output: Not Started.
❌ Accuracy, Compatibility & Optimization: Not Started.
